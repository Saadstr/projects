I moved the engage and remove ship functions from the fleet class and moved them to the skirmish class.
I inheritied the atributes of the Fleet class into the SKirmish class
This was done because it would make sense for the fleet class to create the fleets and another class to actually have the battle.
Modified the main function so instead of calling fleet it calls skirmish.
